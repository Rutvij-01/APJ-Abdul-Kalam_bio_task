<h2 id="#about">About</h2>
<p align ="justify">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
    aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.

    Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the
     next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.
    
    Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
     then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President". He engaged in teaching, 
     writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's 
     highest civilian honour.</p>
    <h2 id="#career">career</h2>
    <p align="justify">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence
         Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and 
         Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in the design of small 
         hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[20] Later, he joined the Indian National Committee 
         for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.[3] He was interviewed and recruited into
          Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket 
          Launching Station.[21]

        In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV)
         which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an 
         expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[22] In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government
          of India to expand the programme to include more engineers.[19] In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center 
          in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility.[2][23] Since the late 1970s, Kalam 
          was part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful</p>

<p align ="justify">Main article: List of honors and awards received by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
    Kalam received honorary doctorates from various universities.[144][145][146] The Government of India honoured him with the
     Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990.[26] In 1997, he was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat 
     Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.[147] He received the 
     Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration in 1997, Savarkar Award in 1998, and Ramanujan Award in 2000.[26] In 2008, he was
      the recipient of Hoover Medal.[148] In 2013, he was awarded the Von Braun Award by the National Space Society "to recognize 
      excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".</p>
<h2 id="#educational_life">Educational Life</h2>
<p align ="justify">Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family.[9][10][11] His ancestors had been wealthy
     Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
      in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved 
      trading goods and transporting passengers between the Indian mainland and the Pamban Island and to and from Sri Lanka. With
       the opening of the Pamban Bridge connecting Pamban Island to mainland India in 1914, the businesses failed. As a result, 
       apart from the ancestral home, the other family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, and the family was poverty-
       stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy, he delivered newspapers to support the family's meager income.</p>
<h2 id="#marriage_life">Marriagelife</h2>
<p align ="justify">APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India and renowned scientist, never married. He remained single 
    throughout his life, focusing on his career and passion for serving his country, particularly through his work in the fields
     of science, technology, and education.

    Kalam often spoke about his personal life and the reasons behind not marrying. He was deeply committed to his work and 
    considered his profession and his dedication to serving the nation as a higher calling. In interviews and writings, he 
    mentioned that his family and friends were supportive of his decision. Kalam was also very close to his parents and his 
    siblings, who were an important part of his life.
    
    While he did not have a spouse or children, Kalam’s life was full of meaningful relationships with his colleagues, students, 
    and the many people who admired him for his vision and contributions to India’s development. He often referred to the youth of 
    India as his "family" and considered them his inspiration.</p>
